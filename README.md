## Presentation

**This project was created by my initiative to help a loved one. It was made for free and for fun. The functionalities are simple and effective:**
- Ability to add, edit or delete an upcoming show
- Possibility to add the name of a person for a booking to a given show, as well as the number of places (if booking for several)
- Possibility to see all the people who have reserved for a show and to delete these reservations.

**The modification of a show** is relatively simple and is done directly on the home with the appearance of a modification form

![editShow](public/assets/gitimages/editshow.png?raw=true "Edit Show")

**The addition of a new booking for a show** is done via the small + button and opens a modal asking for the name and the number of places 

![addBook](public/assets/gitimages/addbook.png?raw=true "New Booking")

**The consultation of reservations for a given show** is very simple: just click on the small eye icon and a summary modal appears

I decided to do it without a framework because the project was small and I wanted to continue to practice the native PHP.
